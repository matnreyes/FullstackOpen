# Simple country database with search functionality
My React app calls the RestCoutriesAPI to get information about countries. I'm using the Axios library to fetch data from RestCountries db. 

App displays capital, population, region, languages, and country flag.

My app also pulls data from the WeatherStackAPI and displays the current weather, wind speed, as well as an icon of the current weather conditions.

# Instructions
On root folder, set the WeatherStackAPI key in an environment variable 'REACT_APP_API_KEY="key"' and start the program as normal.

You can type in the name of a country and click on the search options that come up or type out the country's full name.
